Ben Quackenbush M3OEP

Creates a webstie that will allow an image input then using php and python and then turns that image into a frequency graph where it 
plots the occurrence of each RGB value

language reasons:
php was a good choice due to the large amount of materials I had for it and the ease of finding the file upload code while 
python was used because of cv2 and the familiarity with it due to the guided and applied projects 

call order:
php -> python --- makes file --> php displays 

bugs:
The php shell_exec would not work with cv2 to save my life I have spent hours trying to make it work

expansion: 
first I would make the website work by fixing the shell_exec or changing from cv2 or even python all together 

citations:

all other code written by me or found in guided projects 

grade earned:
40 pts 
There is an attempt at most concepts in module 3 but execution is bad the use of php and python makes sense 
and it's not a super complex project but it is a good demonstraition on module 3 concepts.
